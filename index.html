<h2>Leonard Cohen Would Be Proud of Me I Just Know It</h2>
</header>

<div class = "container">
  <p>
    There are over sixty released covers of Leonard Cohen's 1984 classic, "Hallelujah". Many feature their own original verse. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Writing sixty verses to Halelujah used to be tedious work, but now you never have to come up with your own verse to "Hallelujah" ever again.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the mere touch of a button, you too can have your own original verse, so go on, give that button a touch and make Leonard Cohen proud!
  </p>
